DESCRIPTION:AI-Based Recommendation System using Java

This project implements a simple AI-Based Recommendation System using Core Java and basic data processing techniques. Recommendation systems are an important part of modern applications, helping users discover 

relevant items based on data patterns. They are widely used in platforms such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, online learning portals, and social media applications. This project provides a beginner-

friendly introduction to how recommendation systems work at a fundamental level.

The goal of this project is to recommend items to a target user based on the preferences and interactions of other users. The system follows a collaborative filtering–inspired approach, where recommendations are 

generated by analyzing user-item interaction data. Instead of using complex machine learning libraries, this implementation focuses on logic, data structures, and file handling in Java, making it easy to 

understand for students and beginners.

The application reads input data from a CSV file named ratings.csv. This file contains records in the form of user ID, item ID, and rating. Each row represents a user’s rating for a particular item. The data is 

loaded into a nested HashMap structure, where the outer map stores user IDs and the inner map stores item IDs along with their ratings. This data structure allows efficient access and comparison of user 

preferences.

Once the data is loaded, the system selects a target user for whom recommendations need to be generated. The program then iterates through the data of other users and identifies items that the target user has not 

rated or interacted with. These unseen items are considered potential recommendations. By collecting such items into a set, the system ensures that duplicate recommendations are avoided.

The logic used in this project demonstrates the core idea behind recommendation systems: users with overlapping interests can help suggest new items to one another. Although the system does not calculate 

similarity scores or weighted ratings, it successfully illustrates how user behavior data can be analyzed to generate meaningful recommendations. This simplified approach makes the project ideal for academic 

assignments and learning purposes.

File handling plays a crucial role in this project. The program uses BufferedReader and FileReader to read data efficiently from the CSV file. String processing and type conversion are applied to extract 

numerical values from the file. Proper exception handling ensures that file-related errors are managed safely.

This project helps learners understand important concepts such as data representation, collections framework, file input/output, and algorithmic thinking. It also introduces the basic concept of artificial 

intelligence by showing how systems can make decisions or suggestions based on existing data.

The AI-Based Recommendation System can be extended in many ways. Future enhancements may include calculating similarity between users, ranking recommended items based on ratings, supporting larger datasets, or 

integrating machine learning libraries like Apache Mahout or TensorFlow. A graphical interface or database integration can also be added to make the system more realistic.

Overall, this project serves as a strong foundation for understanding recommendation systems and data-driven applications. It is suitable for mini-projects, academic submissions, and for anyone interested in 

learning how intelligent systems provide personalized recommendations using Java.
